Runnning on iOS:
  Just run npx react-native run-ios
  If you wanna install a native library cd into ios folder and run pod install

Running on Android:
  Open Android studio, go to configure > AVD manager, and launch a device emulator
  Run npx react-native run-android

Any new screens created should be wrapped in the gestureHandlerRootHOC Higher order component
import { gestureHandlerRootHOC } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';

Android doesnt recognize 'localhost' but does 10.0.2.2. Ios Doesnt recognize 10.0.2.2 though.
  run adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080 to get android to connect to localhost port 8080. Change the port # if this changes
